# Clocky for Tildagon

A basic clock app.

This synchronises the time with NTP, then writes the time to the on-board RTC.

* ğŸ“†  Displays the date (ISO8601)
* ğŸ•° Displays the time (24hr)
* ğŸš¨ LEDs display the seconds
* âŒš Minute hand moves every minute
* ğŸ•§ Hour hand also adjusts every minute

**Note** the timezone is hardcoded to BST (UTC+1).

## ToDo

I dunno, you tell me!
